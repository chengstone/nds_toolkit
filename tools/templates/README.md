# NDS Toolkit Templates

This directory contains template code that may assist in NDS Toolkit
development. This will be updated as more templates are added.

## blank_page

```blank_page``` contains the shell for a new page addition. To start working
on a new page, copy the directory into ```/src/pages/```, rename everything
accordingly, then modify the contents of the files to suit your needs.

If you would like to automate this process, check out the ```page_generator```
script in ```tools/code_generation```.
