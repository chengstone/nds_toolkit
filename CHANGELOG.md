# NDS Toolkit Change Log

All changes to the NDS Toolkit will be logged in this change log with each
release.

## 0.1b1

This is my first officially versioned release. It is stable and works to an
extent; the only page that is known to be broken is the Code Porter. It's...
very buggy. Fixing this is top priority for the next release.

## 0.1b2

The second beta has arrived, now with a working Code Porter!

### Bug Fixes

 * Code Porter tab is now functioning as expected, with code type support.

### Known Issues

 * The Code Porter tab strips blank lines from the input when it shouldn't.
