# NDS Toolkit Change Log

All changes to the NDS Toolkit will be logged in this change log with each
release.

## 0.1b1

This is my first officially versioned release. It is stable and works to an
extent; the only page that is known to be broken is the Code Porter. It's...
very buggy. Fixing this is top priority for the next release.

## 0.1b2

The second beta has arrived, now with a working Code Porter!

### Bug Fixes

 * Code Porter tab is now functioning as expected, with code type support.

### Known Issues

 * The Code Porter tab strips blank lines from the input when it shouldn't.

## 0.1b3

This is an emergency patch, to fix a bug that broke the Patch Code Builder. The
first line of its output was bogus; this has been fixed and the builder now
functions as it should.

## 0.1

First stable release.

### Bug Fixes from Beta

 * Fixed buggy behavior of Code Parser, the program is now fully working.

### Goals for Next Release

 * Revamp the Button Activator Generator.
